Now:

- implement minidump parser

- additional CPUID sysinfo stream fields

- parse thread name

- build id logic

- include cgroup membership

Later:

- Proper UTF8-to-UTF16 encoder

- Possibly, full coredump generator, in addition to the existing minicore generator

- some code to find __abort_msg
